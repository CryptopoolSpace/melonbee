You can set up your fund today on the Ethereum main net under 10 minutes and for less than $50, by downloading the Melon Manager Interface (MMI) [here].(https://github.com/melonproject/melon-lab/releases) **(do not download this interface from anywhere else)**.

The [v1.0 release blog post](https://medium.com/melonprotocol/melon-v1-0-zahreddino-60105f51988d) contains detailed instructions.

Once your fund is created, you can manage it through the MMI and you can monitor it or advertise it on the [Melon Monitoring Tool](https://monitoring.melon.network/funds), which allows you to browse the activity on the Melon network.
