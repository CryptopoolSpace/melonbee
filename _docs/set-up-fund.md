You can set up your fund today on the Ethereum main net in a few minutes and for minimal cost on the [Melon Terminal](https://melon.avantgarde.finance/). Since Ethereum gas prices can be quite volatile, we recommend that you check our [monitoring tool](https://monitoring.melon.network) for an estimate of total cost before deploying a fund. Check out this full demo of the Melon Terminal:

That interface also allows you to browse the Melon network and invest in other funds.

You can also monitor the network on the [Melon Monitoring Tool](https://monitoring.melon.network/funds), which allows you to browse the activity on the Melon network.
